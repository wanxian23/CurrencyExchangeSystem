Currency Exchange System is my both Programming I Y1S1 and Programming II Y1S2 projects. 
The first version (Programming I), I developed it using basic C++ concepts which didn't apply concept like arrays.

However, for Programming II, I learnt array, cstring, input/ output file, and pointer. So, I have apply all of them except pointer in the project.
